      <p> <b>Spice DAO </b> is a Web3 production studio publishing sci-fi animation and NFTs from established writers and artists.
      </p>
      <p>The DAO was founded by 800+ pop culture enthusiasts who crowdfunded $12M to win the auction of the Dune Bible at Christieâ€™s Paris in November 2021 for $3M.
      </p>
      <p>We are currently producing an original animated limited series to be distributed by a streaming service and are opening an NFT studio that provides white glove service to high profile creators to develop strategy and concepts; design and build technology products; and advise on marketing campaigns to onboard the next million users to Web3.
      </p>
      <p>The DAO has been featured in The Guardian, The New Yorker, Financial Times, Business Insider, Wired Magazine and more mainstream news outlets. We have a combined following of 10K+ on social media.
